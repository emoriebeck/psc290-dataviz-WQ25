# Final Project Presentations

* Due at 11:59 PM PST on November 28, 2022 on Canvas (visualization or slides)
* Presentations will be in class on November 28 (in person or Zoom)

## Format  
* Up to 4 minute presentation (slides or simply the draft visualization), data blitz style, where you speak on: 
  + Short background (why do you / we care?)
  + Research question(s; only the question[s] you are focusing on)
  + Short method (what are the data? Which are you using?)
  + Showcase your visualization
  + (optional) lingering questions or challenges

## Goal

The goal of this presentation is to: 

* Provide you with feedback from both instructor and classmates on the efficacy of your draft visualization
* Clear up lingering challenges and barriers
* Allow you to practice talking about visualizations of your research

## Scope

As a reminder, there are no restrictions on the scope of your presentation. Some ideas of what's perfectly fine are as follows:

* Introducing a new kind of visualization to your area of research
* Offering improvements to "standard practice" visualizations in your area
* Setting up a procedure for a kind of visualization you've long wanted / needed to figure out
* Really anything that is both useful to you and displays some sort of mastery of course content

## Example

I will give an example data blitz on November 21 to showcase how your presentation may look. I will use the same example (below) that I included in your proposal instructions:

As one brief example, in one of my recent papers, I was interested in the extent to which psychological, situational, and timing factors predicted different momentary experiences and behaviors using person-specific machine learning question ([Beck \& Jackson, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/JJIZZFKKZZPZCIG9VGIU/full)). There were five research questions I was answering more generally, but one was just "Do psychological, situational, time, or full feature sets perform best?" I answered this with the following visualization, which shows the relative proportion of individuals' psychological, situational, and timing features in their best performing model using a "sequence plot" I stole from genetics (which you'll notice looks a lot like a rotated stacked bar chart, which it is!).  

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = F}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/emoriebeck/behavior-prediction/raw/main/05-results/05-figures/fig-3-seq-plot.png",
          destfile = "image.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image.png")
```
