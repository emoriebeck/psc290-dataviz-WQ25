Which are you using?)\n    -   Showcase your visualization\n    -   (optional) lingering questions or challenges\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to:\n\n-   Provide you with feedback from both instructor and classmates on the efficacy of your draft visualization\n-   Clear up lingering challenges and barriers\n-   Allow you to practice talking about visualizations of your research\n\n## Scope\n\nAs a reminder, there are no restrictions on the scope of your presentation. Some ideas of what's perfectly fine are as follows:\n\n-   Introducing a new kind of visualization to your area of research\n-   Offering improvements to \"standard practice\" visualizations in your area\n-   Setting up a procedure for a kind of visualization you've long wanted / needed to figure out\n-   Really anything that is both useful to you and displays some sort of mastery of course content\n\n## Example\n\nI will give an example data blitz on March 5 to showcase how your presentation may look. I will use the same example (below) that I included in your proposal instructions:\n\nAs one brief example, in one of my recent papers, I was interested in the extent to which psychological, situational, and timing factors predicted different momentary experiences and behaviors using person-specific machine learning question ([Beck & Jackson, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/JJIZZFKKZZPZCIG9VGIU/full)). There were five research questions I was answering more generally, but one was just \"Do psychological, situational, time, or full feature sets perform best?\" I answered this with the following visualization, which shows the relative proportion of individuals' psychological, situational, and timing features in their best performing model using a \"sequence plot\" I stole from genetics (which you'll notice looks a lot like a rotated stacked bar chart, which it is!).\n\n```{r, results = 'asis', echo = F}\ndownload.file(url = \"https://github.com/emoriebeck/behavior-prediction/raw/main/05-results/05-figures/fig-3-seq-plot.png\",\n          destfile = \"image.png\",\n          mode = 'wb')\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"image.png\")\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"final-project-presentation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":["cosmo","custom-styles.scss"],"title":"Final Project Presentation","subtitle":"PSC290 - Data Visualization, Winter 2025","author":"Emorie D Beck","institution":"University of California, Davis"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
