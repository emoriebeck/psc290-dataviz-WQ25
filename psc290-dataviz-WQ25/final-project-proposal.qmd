# Final Project Proposals

-   Due at 11:59 PM PST on February 12, 2025 on Canvas
-   1-2 page (single spaced) proposal
    -   Short background (why do you / we care?)
    -   Research question(s; only the question\[s\] you are focusing on)
    -   Short method (what are the data? Which are you using?)
    -   Visualization plan (short summary of your proposed visualization)
    -   Challenges and barriers (what do you struggle with this visualization; are there specific barriers?)

## Visualization Plan

Can be any combination of the following:

Text description

-   clearly describe axes/scales, fills/colors, panels, etc.
-   describe affordances you will build into the visualization to aid understanding
-   describe why you chose this visualization

Draft visualization (digital)

-   rough visualization of some or all of data

Draft visualization (drawn)

-   some roughly drawn visualization showing what you are hoping to do
-   particularly helpful if you foresee barriers or don't know how to do it
-   can also draw these on a plot of yours from the past, etc.

## Goal

The goal of this proposal is to:

-   Provide you with support to build visualizations you may be nervous about
-   Anticipate barriers and provide you tools
-   Set you up to create a visualization that you are proud of

## Scope

What is okay?

-   Introducing a new kind of visualization to your area of research
-   Offering improvements to "standard practice" visualizations in your area
-   Setting up a procedure for a kind of visualization you've long wanted / needed to figure out
-   Really anything that is both useful to you and displays some sort of mastery of course content

## Recommendation

You will have an easier time with this project if you anchor your visualization on a specific research question.

As one brief example, in one of my recent papers, I was interested in the extent to which psychological, situational, and timing factors predicted different momentary experiences and behaviors using person-specific machine learning question ([Beck & Jackson, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/JJIZZFKKZZPZCIG9VGIU/full)). There were five research questions I was answering more generally, but one was just "Do psychological, situational, time, or full feature sets perform best?" I answered this with the following visualization, which shows the relative proportion of individuals' psychological, situational, and timing features in their best performing model using a "sequence plot" I stole from genetics (which you'll notice looks a lot like a rotated stacked bar chart, which it is!).

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = F}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/emoriebeck/behavior-prediction/raw/main/05-results/05-figures/fig-3-seq-plot.png",
          destfile = "image.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image.png")
```

Using a research question will help you to anchor your visualization and allow you to consider the extent to which you think your visualization clearly answers it. While not required, I highly suggest using one.
