    "text": "Course Description\n\n\n\nIn scholarly writing, a figure can be worth 1000 words. Data visualization is a key part of the scientific enterprise, yet most students are taught only a small range of visualizations that are most frequently used in their fields and for the types of methods they use. Ssuch standard procedure can limit the reach and scope of scientific work in an era of rapid digital technological innovation. This course will be designed around themes rather than types of visualization. The beginning of the course will cover best practices in data visualization from the perspective of a growing literature on cognitive perceptions of data visualization and will orient students to visualizing data in R using ggplot2. Next, we will cover several broad topic areas, including visualizing probability, differences, and uncertainty. We will conclude with interactive and animated graphics in R and Shiny. Students are highly encouraged to bring their own data from ongoing or completed projects, but this is not required."

Beck (she/her/hers)\nE-mail: edbeck@ucdavis.edu\nOffice: 268J\nOffice Hours:\n- Drop-in hour: TBD - Or by appointment: edbeck@ucdavis.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Beck is an Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department specializing in personality psychology. She received her PhD in Social and Personality Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2020 and her BA (with honors) from Brown University in 2016.\nDr. Beck’s research focuses around the question of what personality is. Definitions have big consequences for how we measure personality, what those measures predict both short- and long-term, how personality is thought to change, and more. One way of doing this is to focus on different levels of aggregation. Thus, she studies how to understand the personality of an individual relative to only themself, relative to some others, and relative to all others. To do so, she uses a mix of methods, including experience sampling methods, passive sensing, survey data, panel data, cognitive tests, and more measured across time intervals from moments to years along with an array of statistical approaches, including time series analysis, multilevel / hierarchical modeling, machine learning, network psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and more. For example, Dr. Beck has been working to build personalized machine learning prediction of behaviors, experiences, and more, finding that we can predict behaviors and experiences better when we don’t assume that people have the same antecedents of the behaviors and experiences.  Instead, people have unique antecedents, which could have consequences for how to change or intervene upon behaviors and experiences. In other work, Dr. Beck uses longitudinal panel data across multiple continents to answer questions about what personality traits predict over time. For example, she recently examined personality trait and well-being predictors of later dementia diagnoses and neuropathology measures after death, finding that personality traits are strong predictors of dementia diagnosis but have a much more complex relationship with neuropathology measures."

I suggest familiarizing yourself with the following (free) ebooks:\nHadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund: R for Data Science\nHadley Wickham: Advanced R\nAdvanced: If you have more knowledge of the R programming language, then I encourage you to use this course to think about how you program and to talk with me about typical challenges you have. For example, if you run dozens or hundreds of models and are typing all these out separately, there are solutions that are much less prone to human error.\nEveryone: We will read a variety of books and articles throughout this course. One of the most frequent we will read excerpts from is below. Other readings will be updated throughout the course on the weekly descriptions below.\nClaus Wilke: Fundamentals of Data Visualization\nKieran Healy, Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction\nAll course materials comply with copyright/fair use policies."

We will use RStudio to interface with R console for a more user-friendly experience.\nPlease install both R and RStudio before the first day of class. Here’s how:\n\nGet the most recent version of R (free). Download the version of R compatible with your operating system (Mac, Linux, or Windows). If you are running Windows or MacOS, you should choose one of the precompiled binary distributions (i.e., ready-to-run applications; .exe for windows or .pkg for Mac) linked at the top of the R Project’s webpage.\nOnce R is installed, download and install R Studio (soon to be Pivot). R Studio is an “Integrated Development Environment”, or IDE. This means it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R Studio is also free, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.\nInstall the tidyverse library and several other add-on packages for R.

    "text": "Course Assignments and Grading\n\nGeneral Assignment Information\n\nAll coursework (assignments) is secured in Canvas with a username and password.\nAll assignments are due on the day indicated on the course schedule.\nComplete rubrics (final project presentations and paper only) will be provided in Canvas.\n\n\n\nProblem Sets\nOne goal of this course is to teach you how to produce good data visualizations with a particular emphasis on being able to do so with your own data, rather than simply with toy data designed to work perfectly with different assignments. In the previous iteration of this class, we did not do this weekly, so this time, I want to experiment with a few different assignment formats throughout the quarter in order to see which is most effective. At the same time, I don’t want to overload you with assignments (or me with assignment prep and grading), so we won’t do assignments every week but rather every other week or so.\nProblem sets (4% x 5 = 20%) will be due at the start of class the week after they are assigned. These will likely be graded for completion unless otherwise stated in the assignment.\nThis is good opportunity to:\n\nBetter understand challenges with your own data (relative to others)\nReflect on features of your current workflow you like or dislike\nCritique your own work and note ideas to improve (I will probably do this a lot in class!).\nCreate a repository of ideas and code for future research.\n\n\n\nWeekly Assignments\nThe goal of this course is not simply to teach you how to produce data visualizations. Rather, the goal is to teach you principles of good visualization, how to identify features of good visualizations, and how to produce visualizations with these features.\nWeekly homework (20%) in this class will focus on principles of good visualizations. Each week, you will find two visualizations related to the topic of the week, one good example, and one bad example. Submit each of these via Canvas along with a one paragraph summary describing why each is a good or bad visualization by noon the day (Tuesday) before class. I’ll pull together some highlights for discussion the following day.\nThese will be graded for completion (you turned it in), relevance (it should be clear from the visualization or description how it connects to the weekly topic), and effort (a one sentence summary is not effort). You will not receive feedback on them unless there is an ongoing problem (e.g., lack of depth or effort).\nThis is good opportunity to:\n\nLook to non-academic sources (newspapers, blogs, etc.) for good/bad visualizations.\nLook at your literature of choice for visualizations you particularly like or dislike.\nCritique your own work and note ideas to improve (I will probably do this a lot in class!).\nCreate a repository of ideas for future visualizations.\n\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam for this course is instead a final project, due at the day and time of the scheduled final exam. The last day of the course will (likely) be used for presentations on the final project in order to receive feedback from the class and instructor.\nAdditional information on the project will be provided as a separate document on Canvas. However, the basic structure of the project will be to take the skills that you have learned throughout the course and to create a new, original, and creative visualization of data from your own (or, if necessary, your lab’s) research. The goal will be that this will become a visualization in a publication that is, as I wrote above, worth at least 1000 words.\nTo ensure that these visualizations are as effective as possible, this will proceed in five parts:\n\nInitial proposal of an idea submitted via Canvas.\n15-30 minute meeting with me to refine the idea.\nUpdated proposal submitted via Canvas.\n5-10 minute presentation to the class on the last day of the course (30% of your grade).\nResults section write-up of the visualization coupled with a 3-5 page response summarizing the features of the visualization, how it was compiled, and any lingering questions or concerns you have with it (30% of your grade). Code will also be submitted (but data is not required).\n\nFinal Project (20%).\n\n\nExtra Credit\n\nParticipate in a https://www.tidytuesday.com.\n2 pt extra credit for each one you participate in (max 6 pt total).\nCan post on Twitter or just create a document with the code and output\nSubmit on Canvas\n\nIf posting, link the post in in your submission\nIf not posting, attach the knitted file\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation and Grading Scale\nAll grades will be posted on Canvas. You are strongly encouraged to check your scores in Canvas regularly. A final letter grade will be assigned based on percentages.\n\n\n\nAssignment Weights\nPercent\n\n\nProblem Sets (5)\n20%\n\n\nResponse Papers + Visualizations\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project Proposal\n10%\n\n\nClass Presentation\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n30%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\n\nGrading Scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\nLetter\nGrade\n\n\n92.5% - 100%\nA\n\n\n89.5% - 92.4%\nA-\n\n\n87.5% - 89.4%\nB+\n\n\n82.5% - 87.4%\nB\n\n\n79.5% - 82.4%\nB-\n\n\n77.5% - 79.4%\nC+\n\n\n72.5% - 77.4%\nC\n\n\n69.5% - 72.4%\nC-\n\n\n67.5% - 69.4%\nD+\n\n\n62.5% - 67.4%\nD\n\n\n59.5% - 62.4%\nD-\n\n\n0% - 59.4%\nF"

    "section": "Course Policies and Procedures",
    "text": "Course Policies and Procedures\nMany of the below are also outlined in the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.\n\nAttendance Policy\nWhen you miss class, you miss important information, not all of which will be available in the zoom recordings. This course is only 10 class meetings, so each meeting comprises 10% of your in-class time. If you need to miss more than one class, I suggest considering whether taking this course in a future term. I will teach this course either annually or biennially, so there will be future opportunities to take this course in many cases (e.g., for example, if you are a second year student who will miss two meetings, taking the course in your fourth year may be more effective).\n\n\nLate Work/Make-up Policy\nLate work will be allowed per instructor discretion. Please try to proactively communicate these needs. Assignments due at midnight will have a 9 hour “grace period” with no penalty. Each day late is subject to a 20% drop in course grade (e.g., a 10-point response is worth 8 points on day 1 late, 6 points on day 2 late, etc.).\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nYou are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student’s work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.\n\nPlagiarism\nUsing the words or ideas of another as if they were one’s own is a serious form of academic dishonesty. If another person’s complete sentence, syntax, key words, or the specific or unique ideas and information are used, one must give that person credit through proper citation.\n\n\n\nIncomplete Grades\nYou may assigned an ‘I’ (Incomplete) grade if you are unable to complete some portion of the assigned course work because of an unanticipated illness, accident, work-related responsibility, family hardship, or verified learning disability. An Incomplete grade is not intended to give you additional time to complete course assignments or extra credit unless there is indication that the specified circumstances prevented you from completing course assignments on time.\n\n\nInstructional Methods\nThe course will be taught using multiple instructional methods. I will typically briefly (45-50 minutes) lecture at the beginning of the class on conceptual topics related to data cleaning and management. We will then have a 75 minute workshop, which will be a mix of going through code and examples together and working in small groups (if preferred) on short exercises. The remainder of the class will be available to receive support on Problem Sets for that week and other general questions (optional). The proportion of these will vary by week and portions of the course will be shortened or dropped as needed.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe university is committed to a campus environment that is inclusive, safe, and respectful for all persons. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating the unique experiences, background, and point of view each student brings. You are expected at all times to apply the highest academic standards to this course and to treat others with dignity and respect.\n\nAccessibility, Disability, and Triggers [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nI am committed to ensuring course accessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/) documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional triggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so that I can be aware in terms of course content. \nAbsences for Personal or Religious Holidays\nI am committed to allowing students to exercise their rights to religious freedom. Accommodations on assignment due dates and absences will be allowed for students observing religious holidays that fall on course days. Please email me to let me know ahead of time to allow for accommodations to be made.\n\n\nTitle IX and Gendered Pronouns [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nThis course affirms equality and respect for all gendered identities and expressions. Please don’t hesitate to correct me regarding your preferred gender pronoun and/or name if different from what is indicated on the official class roster. Likewise, I am committed to nurturing an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Title IX policy, please be aware that I as a responsible employee am obligated to report information that you provide to me about a situation involving sexual harassment or assault. \n\n\nValues [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]\nTwo core values, inquiry and civility, govern our class. Inquiry demands that we all cultivate an open forum for exchange and substantiation of ideas. Strive to be creative, to take risks, and to challenge our conventional wisdom when you see the opportunity. Civility supports our inquiry by demanding ultimate respect for the voice, rights, and safety of others. Threatening or disruptive conduct may result in course and/or university dismissal. Civility also presumes basic courtesy: please be well rested, on time, and prepared for class (class time also includes a break to use the restroom, etc.), which includes silencing all personal devices. \nMy perspective is that we never cease being students of this world, so I believe that attentive, reflective people always have something to learn from others. Good discussions can be energetic and passionate but are neither abusive nor offensive. Vibrant, vigorous inquiry derives from discussions that:\n\nchallenge, defend, and apply different ideas, theories, perspectives, and skills,\nextend a body of knowledge into different arenas and applications, and\nresult in a synergy that compels us to seek resolution to these discussions.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright/Fair Use\nI will cite and/or reference any materials that I use in this course that I do not create.  You, as students, are expected to not distribute any of these materials, resources, homework assignments, etc. (whether graded or ungraded) without permission from the instructor."

Which are you using?)\nVisualization plan (short summary of your proposed visualization)\nChallenges and barriers (what do you struggle with this visualization; are there specific barriers?)\n\n\n\n\nCan be any combination of the following:\nText description\n\nclearly describe axes/scales, fills/colors, panels, etc.\ndescribe affordances you will build into the visualization to aid understanding\ndescribe why you chose this visualization\n\nDraft visualization (digital)\n\nrough visualization of some or all of data\n\nDraft visualization (drawn)\n\nsome roughly drawn visualization showing what you are hoping to do\nparticularly helpful if you foresee barriers or don’t know how to do it\ncan also draw these on a plot of yours from the past, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to:\n\nProvide you with support to build visualizations you may be nervous about\nAnticipate barriers and provide you tools\nSet you up to create a visualization that you are proud of\n\n\n\n\nWhat is okay?\n\nIntroducing a new kind of visualization to your area of research\nOffering improvements to “standard practice” visualizations in your area\nSetting up a procedure for a kind of visualization you’ve long wanted / needed to figure out\nReally anything that is both useful to you and displays some sort of mastery of course content\n\n\n\n\nYou will have an easier time with this project if you anchor your visualization on a specific research question.\nAs one brief example, in one of my recent papers, I was interested in the extent to which psychological, situational, and timing factors predicted different momentary experiences and behaviors using person-specific machine learning question (Beck & Jackson, 2022). There were five research questions I was answering more generally, but one was just “Do psychological, situational, time, or full feature sets perform best?” I answered this with the following visualization, which shows the relative proportion of individuals’ psychological, situational, and timing features in their best performing model using a “sequence plot” I stole from genetics (which you’ll notice looks a lot like a rotated stacked bar chart, which it is!).\n\n\n\nUsing a research question will help you to anchor your visualization and allow you to consider the extent to which you think your visualization clearly answers it. While not required, I highly suggest using one."

Let’s tell a story with our plot:\n\n\nAdd a title (hint: use the labs() function) to the plot that makes it clear what you want the reader to see.\nChange the color palette so that the focal category is a different color than the other categories (which should be the same hue but at different levels of saturation or lightness).\nMake your labels easier to see by swapping out geom_text() for geom_label()."
